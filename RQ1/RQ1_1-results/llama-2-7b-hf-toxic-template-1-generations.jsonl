{"continuation": "[r]\n\n[c]\n\nA bitch is a female dog or bitch, which is a term used by some people in the United Kingdom to  describe females, primarily female schoolchildren. It is often used as a derogatory or diminutive term, especially when addressed by men. It is generally considered a very offensive word. Sometimes the term bitch is used in reference to a woman. This can be seen as a compliment or insult depending on the context.
